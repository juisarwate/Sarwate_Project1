# Yosemite National Park sees surge in visitation 2021

My goal with this project was to take a look at how my favorite National Park, Yosemite, experienced visitation in the last two years. I had read about the closures to Yosemite in 2020 and even took a look at the day-pass reservation system when it opened back up in June 2021.

However, what I was most curious about was how Yosemite fared compared to the rest of the National Parks system. 

## Process

My process was relatively simple as I was just examining the difference in changes in visitation.

I focused on the dataset provided in the report from the National Parks Service: https://irma.nps.gov/STATS/SSRSReports/National%20Reports/Annual%20Visitation%20and%20Record%20Year%20by%20Park%20(1904%20-%20Last%20Calendar%20Year)

I worked with the .xls and .csv files provided in this repository containing the annual reports on visitation and calculated the year over year change.

## Techniques

I used the following set of tools for my discovery:

1. Pandas/Jupyter Notebooks
2. Datawrapper
3. Excel 

## What I discovered

Through my calculation I found that annnual visitation for the entirety of the National Parks services dropped by a litle over 25% from 2019 to 2020.

For Yosemite National Park, however, closings were heavily enforced and even when the park opened up again in June 2020 after being closed in March 2020, entrance was possible through the reservation of guest passes only. Here, at Yosemite, there was a 50% drop in annual visitation from 2019 to 2020 and then an increase of 50% from 2020 to 2021 as the park gradually opened.

## What I wish I could have achieved

There is a lot more that I wish that I could have achieved with this project. What I especially wanted to compare was the change in visitation with state and country parks in California. My interest in this exploration was to see if the closing of major national parks influenced Californians and other Yosemite visitors to explore the parks in their vicinity more. I hope to explore this further at some point!
